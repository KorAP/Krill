      "message": "Seems to work well in the sense that KWICs are capped (approximately?) reliably, without capping the match unnecessarily üëç. Tested with Kalamar and API (tokens and snippets). However, I don\u0027t know what the old and new properties now actually mean. Please explain everything in `src/main/resources/krill.properties.info`.\n\nWhat I liked more in my initial attempt was that the `krill.kwic.max.token` property reflects 1:1 what users need and is thus easily understandable without much explanation (but see https://korap.ids-mannheim.de/gerrit/c/KorAP/Krill/+/9704/6/src/main/resources/krill.properties.info#29). \n\nFor what purpose users might indeed also still need `krill.match.max.token` might need some explanation. I still cannot figure out `krill.kwic.context.token` could be used for üòú.",

      "message": "I agree, that the semantics are more complicated, but as users don\u0027t need to care, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s an issue.\n\nWhat wasn\u0027t possible with the KWIC solution, that we discussed on wednesday, was the restriction to match sizes of e.g. 10 (to prevent the reconstruction of texts based on sentences), while still allowing the maximum context size.",

      "message": "The restriction of max match size is indeed needed, as I said. Users, in the sense of people who try to run KorAP, should just get a hint for what.\n\nWhat is not needed, IMHO, is max context size. Max KWIC size is a better alternative, I think, and everything else can be computed on the fly for an optimal or easy solution. But you can try to explain it to me on Monday, if I\u0027m wrong üòä",

      "message": "It\u0027s probably easier to understand, but it removes the flexibility to still have fixed context (if I understand your proposal), regardless of the match length. It also - and that\u0027s usual my main issue - removes the option of the current behaviour. What would be a behaviour that the current option can\u0027t achieve?",
