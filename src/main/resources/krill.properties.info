# Token retrieval settings:
#
# krill.match.max.token = 5
#
##  Maximum number (i.e. length) of tokens to be retrievable.
##  Matches longer than that will be cut.
##  Defaults to 50

# krill.context.max.token = 
#
##  Maximum number (i.e. length) of tokens to be retrieved (left and right) of a match.
##  Defaults to 60

# krill.context.left.adjust = 0
#
## Number of tokens (for now) from the match that will reduce the left context to be retrieved.
## Defaults to 0, meaning the maximum context will be retrieved if requested, unaltered by the match size.
## Supported is also "max", which means the whole context can be reduced, if the match is large
## (That means, if both context adjustments are set to "max", the maximum KWIC length equals match.max.token).
## Adjustment by match length will be done evenly for both sides of the context.

# krill.context.right.adjust
#
## Number of tokens (for now) from the match that will reduce the right context to be retrieved.
## Defaults to 0, meaning the maximum context will be retrieved if requested, unaltered by the match size.
## Supported is also "max", which means the whole context can be reduced, if the match is large
## (That means, if both context adjustments are set to "max", the maximum KWIC length equals match.max.token).
## Adjustment by match length will be done evenly for both sides of the context.
